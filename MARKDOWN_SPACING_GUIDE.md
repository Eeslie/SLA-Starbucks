# Markdown Spacing Guide for Articles

## ✅ How to Add Spacing in Articles

### 1. **Between Paragraphs**
Use **double line breaks** (press Enter twice):

```markdown
This is paragraph one.

This is paragraph two with proper spacing.
```

### 2. **Between Sections**
Use horizontal rule `---` for visual separation:

```markdown
## Section One

Content here...

---

## Section Two

More content here...
```

### 3. **Before Lists**
Add a blank line before lists:

```markdown
Here are the steps:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

### 4. **In Lists**
Each list item automatically has spacing, but you can add more:

```markdown
- Item one

- Item two

- Item three
```

### 5. **After Headings**
Add a blank line after headings:

```markdown
## Heading Title

Content starts here...
```
